# Inventory Application

![Home screen](https://i.imgur.com/SHVhRsu.png)

A CRUD headphone inventory application made with Express and Pug, as well as MongoDB for persistence and the multer library for multipart form data.

The homepage displays a list of all headphones, along with their pictures, brands and prices. On the sidebar, you can also see links to the list of brands and categories, as well as links to the pages wherein you create new items (be it headphones, brands or categories).

When you're viewing a specific item's page, you'll also see links to its delete and update pages. Those pages, however, are only accessible if you enter the admin password upon clicking on them.
